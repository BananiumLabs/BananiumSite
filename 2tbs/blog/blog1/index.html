        <hr>



        <p>
            &emsp; 
            Hello and welcome to 2TBS’s first Blog Post! In our blogs, we’ll talk about anything and everything that goes on behind
            the scenes when we’re making games!

        </p>



        <p>
             &emsp;
            If you don’t know who we are, we’re just a small group of high-school game developers that aims to teach fellow students
            game development and to create great games ourselves! We started in Fall of 2016 and has gone through many… let’s
            just say ups and downs! However, despite out many downs, we always stuck together out of friendship and the desire
            to make great games! Since of late, we have been picking up steam with the recent release of Squadron Dragon
            and the current production of Sigil. You can get more information about these game by exploring our website!

        </p>



        <p>
            &emsp;
            We may be “game developers”, but we still do everything any normal gamer and human does: from auto-locking your favorite
            champion to binge watching Netflix every friday night (and every night really). Some blogs will talk about how
            we went about implementing a certain algorithm or composing music for our game, and some will be about how chins
            are the most significant part of the human body (that’s a blog for another day)!


        </p>



        <p>
            &emsp;
            In this blog post, I’ll talk about our recent endeavors in improving our development cycle. This is a rather long story,
            so sit back, relax, and listen to some Hyrule Orchestra. Without further ado, let’s begin!
        </p>


        <p>
            &emsp;
            The months before December was kind of slow for us. Since most of the team consists of Juniors and our school is incredibly
            pressuring, a lot of us did not have time to work on making games. It was kind of sad to walk into our meeting
            and see everyone talk about American Literature Honors and Calculus BC and not about the games we should be making.
            To fix this problem, me, Ben, and Alexey agreed to focus our efforts on making a quick game during winter break.

        </p>


        <p>
            &emsp;
            When we got out of school on December 19, we immediately flew to our computers and started working! We agreed that we wanted
            to make a small 7-day game with the new development schedule we made beforehand. Determined to finish this game,
            we worked for hours each day, coding up logic, making assets, composing music, and fixing merge conflicts (i
            reallly realllly hate merge conflicts in Unity). In the end, we made a game that is known as Squadron Dragon,
            a game much like Space Invaders but with bouncing projectiles!


        </p>


        <p>
            &emsp;
            Making a video game is like making a piece of artwork. When you get a lot done in one sitting, it feels super satisfying.
            The satisfaction of committing and pushing a huge change into the main repository is like the satisfaction you
            feel when you carry your team with your epic Mercy skills; you feel like the MVP, the team player, the busy bee.
            This satisfaction drove me and my team to actively work on this game.


        </p>


        <p>
            &emsp;
            While we made this game very effectively and efficiently, there were definitely many mistakes and tasks we forgot to consider.
            Again, this is a lot like art; when you mess up, you feel disheartened, but you work around it. In fact, projectile
            bouncing was not even a main feature of the game until I came across the difficulty of destroying bullet objects
            after it hits a ship! From both laziness and the sheer joy to see a bullet bouncing around the screen, this error
            inspired us to keep this mechanic, totally redefining what our game was about.



        </p>


        <p>
            &emsp;
            While we focused on making a game, we actually made something greater… friendship (ik ik, that was cheesy, but it’s true)!
            We got to know one another much more through teamwork and memes! The first meme that comes to mind is Akash’s
            godly chin (again, a blog for another day). I also distinctly remember me and Akash’s godly chine being racially
            identified as PANK for being a game designer.


        </p>


        <p>
            &emsp;
            After publishing this game, we enjoyed the rest of our break, reinvigorated with the desire to make great games with our
            team in 2018.



        </p>


        <p>
            &emsp;
            Well, here we are, in 2018, making a game much in the likes of Bejeweled 3 (and, bleh, Candy Crush). The game is called Sigil
            and we plan to finish it in the next 2 weeks (but don’t quote me on that :P ).

            Thank you for reading this blog! If you liked this blog, check out our website often for new blog posts! I’m Omar Hossain,
            a coder, designer, and team manager of the team and I plan to write often, but there’ll be other great people
            to write blogs, sharing their point of views and their own cool stories. That being said, it’s 11:41 Pm at night
            and I am SLEEPY. I hope you get a Chicken Dinner and have a great day!

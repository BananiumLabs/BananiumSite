                        Hi! We're <b>Bananium Labs</b>, an organization of student developers who work on a variety of projects, from tinkering with hardware to VR games. Since Bananium was founded in 2017, we have been continuously in development, looking for new ways to improve our skills and organization outreach.
                        <br><br>

                        One of our major projects was <a href="https://launchhacks.bananiumlabs.com">LaunchHacks</a>, a hackathon hosted by us for 100 high school students in April 2019. If you're looking to host a hackathon of your own, <a href="mailto:contact@bananiumlabs.com">contact us</a> and we'll do our best to help you get started.

                        <br><br>

                        If you'd like to take a look at some of our projects, we've created a listing of all of the projects that have been created by members and affiliates of Bananium Labs over the years.

                        <br><br>

                        Bananium Labs is also a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit! We hope to inspire fellow students to create impactful projects with technology, and make some projects of our own as well. If you'd like to support our cause,
                        please consider submitting a donation (tax deductible): our donation button is located at the bottom of our page.
